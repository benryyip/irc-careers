## Requirements
In order to run these bots, you'll need to install RubyGems and `daemons`.

1. To install RubyGems, read the [RubyGems documentation](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3).

2. To install `daemons`, we can use RubyGems:

   `$ sudo gem install daemons`

Now you're all set!

## Running your bots
Included is a handy launcher script, `launcher.rb`. Go ahead and check out the
help by running:

`$ ./launcher.rb`
